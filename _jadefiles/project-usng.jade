    .bodyText My internship has structured the majority of our projects and data with a spatial data model based on the US National Grid system. This centers around the idea of taking a model used for location identifying and applying data to it. Though it has the appearance of raster data, it is entirely vector based and has seemingly infitie flexibility with the types and amount of data that can be joined to the grid cells.
