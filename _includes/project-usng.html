This centers around the idea of taking a model used for location identifying and applying data to it. Though it has the appearance of raster data, it is entirely vector based and has seemingly infitie flexibility with the types and amount of data that can be joined to the grid cells. </div><br/><br/><div style="text-align:center" class="bodyText">The majority of our work has been culminated and summarized into a website here: <a href="http://fl-usng-gis.org/index.html">FL USNG GIS</a></div></div>
