**Thursday-Friday**

Travel to New Jersey from Florida went rather smoothly and was done in what seemed like shorter than 15 hours. Our car arrived in Union City, New Jersey around noon and not much time was spent there before we took to the city on the bus. Walking out of the Port Authority on the other end of the Lincoln Tunnel was overwhelming. It being my first time in New York, the sheer number of people from all kinds of history and the pure movement in my view was enough to stop me in my tracks.

After waking up and getting out of our Airbnb a little later than anticipated we were able to make it to Bellworks in Holmdel, NJ for the finale of the hackathon season.
