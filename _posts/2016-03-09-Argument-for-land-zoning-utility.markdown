If a high rise building has more economic or social output with a ratio of square foot to land area would it be better than a less efficient land of one story buildings with higher overall land area.

This is an example of how land use might be flawed by simply using and land area measurement rather than understanding what actually influences the economic and social production of the area per square foot.
