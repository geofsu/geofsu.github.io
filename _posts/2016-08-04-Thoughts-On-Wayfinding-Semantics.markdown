title: "Thoughts on Way-finding Semantics"
---

How people navigate cities is an interesting phenomenon and one to be thoroughly explored. In order for computers to get better at delivering way-finding systems and navigation, strides in the understanding of connotational distance estimations and turn-by-turn directions need to occur.

Depending on the urban city model of the place, or lack there of, a way that people communicate distance can be skewed significantly. The primary mode of transit, whether it be personal car, bus, bike, or pedestrian influences how people judge differences. Within each of these modes of transit, there are norms for distance estimations. For cars, traffic patterns heavily influence how distance or directions are communicated. In large metro urban areas such as Los Angeles, distance is usually estimated in time of travel rather than any distance measures because that is the main variable affecting the travel experience. In many locations, time is a more appropriate estimate of distance because of how much the automobile makes distance a lesser problem in travel.

In a pedestrian sense, the scale of directions is on a much small scale so distance is a more appropriate measure is most cases, but time is also used in some cases. To encourage walkability, time is a good unit of measure because the actual distance might be a deterrent in the mind of the pedestrian. Five minutes seems a lot easier walk than 1500 feet.

Regional names for roads can also affect the way that people navigate and can automatically imply and distance or time variable within it. A highway with a shortened nickname such as "The Parkway" become almost completely incomprehensible to a non-local but can give a local a time estimate based on the commonly used exits to main artery roads.
